# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born
desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand
streamlining others work to find optimal jobs
Data hails from my [SQL Course] (https://
lukebarousse.com/sql). It's tacked with insights
on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential
skills.
The questions I wanted to answer through my
SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn
# Toots I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market,
I harnessed the power Of several key toots:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to
query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management
system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database
management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and
sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring
collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating
specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered
data analyst positions by average yearly salary
and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query
highlights the high paying opportunities in the
field.
```SQL
SELECT
    job_id ,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim cd 
ON jpf.company_id=cd.company_id
WHERE
     job_title_short='Data Analyst' AND
     job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
     salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown Of the top data analyst jobs
